# Valmod-Expansion
Valmod Pack - Expansion Edition - French Frog MOD

This is a fork of the Valmod Pack - Expansion Edition.
1. My main goal is to add some new classes :
 - Spy (ok, but the class perks may be adjusted),
 - Farmer (ok, but the class perks may be adjusted),
 - Others if I find inspiration (example : Thug, Nudist, etc...).
2. I also want to create and add new challenges to the Valmod mod :
 - New classes specifics challenges,
 - PvP challenges.
3. I also wouldlike to mod the loot system in order to loot more bullets to create a more PvP flavoured mod.
4. Finally, I may edit the blood moon mechanics in order to modify the 7 days delay to 30 days.
5. Misc : I also may translate the mod to french.

I work with Notepad++, Gimp, Github Desktop and MobaXTerm on a MS Windows 10 x64 PC.

Cheers, and thanks for reading.
